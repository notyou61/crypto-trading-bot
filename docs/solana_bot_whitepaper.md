# White Paper: Automated Meme Coin Trading Bot on Solana (Pump.fun Strategy)

## Executive Summary

This white paper outlines the development, strategy, implementation, and operational approach behind an automated trading bot targeting meme coin launches on the Solana blockchain via the Pump.fun platform. Through intelligent trade filtering, conservative capital deployment, and structured reinvestment, this bot aims to deliver sustainable daily profits while mitigating risk.

---

## Project Goals

* Identify early-stage meme coin launches with high growth potential
* Automate trade execution with buy-in logic, exit strategy, and slippage management
* Simulate real-world constraints including transaction fees, price decay, and liquidity
* Generate consistent profit with minimal human oversight

---

## System Architecture

### A. Data Collection & Filtering

* Monitors token creation events using Solana RPC or Helius API
* Pulls buyer activity in first 10s, 30s, and 5m windows
* Simulates price trajectory using on-chain data or randomized modeling

### B. Decision Engine

#### v2 Strategy (Legacy)
* **Buy Trigger:** Enters with 0.05‚Äì0.1 SOL if Buyers10s ‚â• 5
* **Exit Logic:**
  - Moonshot: +200% price held ‚â• 60s (~0.20 SOL profit)
  - Partial Exit: +50% fallback (~0.05 SOL profit)
  - Skipped: If momentum or duration is weak

#### v3 Strategy (Current)
* **Buy Trigger:** Enters **only after price has already increased by at least +10%** (profit-in-place)
* **Exit Logic:**
  - Moonshot: +200% AND held ‚â• 60s
  - Partial Exit: +50% OR no moonshot within max 120s hold
  - Timeout: Trade is exited if no valid gain within hold window

### C. Slippage + Fees

* Deducts 0.0001 SOL fixed fee
* Applies 1‚Äì5% slippage adjustment depending on price action simulation

### D. Logging

Each trade logs:
* Timestamp
* Buyers (10s/30s/5m)
* Entry trigger type (Buyers10s, ProfitInPlace)
* Entry price, Exit price
* Profit (SOL & USD)
* Strategy decision (Skipped, Partial, Moonshot, Timed Out)

### E. Trade Execution

* Uses Jupiter Aggregator API for swaps
* Wallet funded with secure Solana key
* Uses `@solana/web3.js` + `@jup-ag/core` for trade submission

## Startup Strategy: Snowballing from Low Capital

To reduce initial risk, the bot begins with a minimal starting balance (e.g., 0.1‚Äì0.5 SOL). Profits are recycled into future trades until a working capital of 5 SOL is achieved.

**Rules:**
* Start with 0.05‚Äì0.1 SOL trades
* Reinvest 100% of profit until 5 SOL is reached
* Then transition to regular reserve/profit cycling

---

## Continuous Operation

### A. Runtime

The bot is designed for continuous operation, driven by real-time token creation events on Pump.fun.

### B. Profits

Updated strategy consistently yields ~0.05 SOL/trade

### C. Reinvestment and Reserve Logic

* **Snowball Phase:** Reinvest all profits until reaching 5 SOL
* **Post-Snowball:**
  - Withdraw 50% of weekly net profit
  - Recycle remaining into bankroll
  - Maintain buffer to survive streaks of low output or negative trades

---

## Profit Expectations

### Updated Realistic Throughput Estimate

* ‚úÖ Partial Exits/hour: ~18
* üí∞ Avg. Profit/Partial Exit: 0.05 SOL
* üßæ Total Profit/hour: ~0.9 SOL
* üíµ Estimated USD/hour (@ $166/SOL): ~$149.40

---

## Wallet Architecture & Profit Management

### 1. Initial Capital Setup

* Begin with 0.5 SOL to initiate the snowball protocol
* Source of funds: Phantom wallet or exchange
* Buy-in: 0.05‚Äì0.1 SOL per trade

### 2. Wallet Roles & Flow

* üéØ Hot Wallet: Bot trades from here
* üè¶ Payout Wallet: Receives 50% weekly profits
* üßä Cold Storage: Backup/reserve allocation

### 3. Automation & Monitoring

* Hourly cron job:
  - Transfers to Payout/Cold Wallet
  - Sends email confirmations
  - Alerts for missed transfers or errors

---

## Development Lifecycle

### Stage 1: Historical Backtesting
* Analyze past Pump.fun launches using JSON + blockchain snapshots
* Validate triggers and profit logic (Buyers10s, Profit-in-Place)

### Stage 2: Simulated Trading (Paper Trading)
* Run bot logic in real-time with no capital

### Stage 3: Live Trading (Real Capital)
* Activate trades via secure wallet
* Begin Snowball strategy

## Conclusion

This project presents a viable, adaptable framework for trading meme coins on Solana in an automated and risk-managed fashion. The updated v3 strategy allows for a "wait-and-see" profit confirmation entry, reducing false positives and ensuring safer deployments. With structured reinvestment and modular control, the bot can scale from experimentation to profitability with minimal human oversight.
